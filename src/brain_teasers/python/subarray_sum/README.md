import the below snippet to the test_file, so that you be able to run the test file.

Adding the project root to sys.path is necessary when running tests or scripts that need to import modules from different directories, especially when those modules are not in the same directory as the test or script file.

When we run the test file, it will go and look for the imported modules.

```py
# tests/test_subarray_sum.py
import unittest
import sys
import os

# Add the project root directory to sys.path
sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))

# Now you can import the module
from src.subarray_sum import subarray_sum

```

The presence of the **init**.py file in a directory is what signals to Python that the directory should be treated as a package. If a directory has an **init**.py file, it becomes a package, and you can import modules from that directory in other parts of your project.

Without the **init**.py file, Python does not recognize the directory as a package, and you won't be able to import modules from it. The **init**.py file is essential for package initialization and indicating that the directory should be part of the Python module namespace.

So, in your case, with the **init**.py file in the src directory, it becomes a package, and you can import the sum module from it in other parts of your project. If the **init**.py file were absent, Python would not treat src as a package, and you would encounter import errors.

### Subarray Sum Function

##### Overview

This Python function, subarray_sum, is designed to calculate and return the sum of elements in a subarray, given a list of integers and the start and end indices for summation.

#### Parameters

arr: List of integers representing the array from which the subarray sum is calculated.
start_index: Start index of the subarray for summation.
end_index: End index of the subarray for summation.

#### Return Value

Returns the sum of elements in the specified subarray.

#### Error Handling

Raises a ValueError if the provided indices are out of range.

#### Example Usage

```py
my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Calculate the sum of subarray from index 1 to 3
result = subarray_sum(my_array, 1, 3)

print(result)
# Output: 9


```
